## URL Shortener Project

This project was just an initial venture into Flask and Python web applications. To use, download the project and run it. The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. 

To make the project accessible through GitHub, there is an index.html home page with a button that will take you to the actual URL shortener site.
